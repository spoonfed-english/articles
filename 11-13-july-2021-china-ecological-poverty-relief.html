	<section class="text">
		<p>In China, the forestry and grassland bureaus have worked hard for nearly 10 years at alleviating the country' s <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span>-stricken farmers through ecological <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">compensation</span>, forestation, and developing the ecological industry. They have <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">actively</span> practised the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">philosophy</span> that "lucid waters and lush mountains are <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">invaluable</span> assets." These bureaus have managed to reach all their <span class="word high" data-lemma="goal" tabindex="-1">goals</span> to reduce <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span> through ecological <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">compensation</span> and restoration. Over 20 million poor people have <span class="word high" data-lemma="benefit" tabindex="-1">benefited</span> from their <span class="word high" data-lemma="policy" tabindex="-1">policies</span>.</p>
		<p>One forest ranger in Yunnan province is often seen walking, in her local ethnic clothing, through the mountain forest. <span class="word low" data-lemma="accord" tabindex="-1">According</span> to her, she has been able to take care of her family and has <span class="word med" data-lemma="participate" tabindex="-1">participated</span> in under-forest industries such as planting black cardamom, growing traditional Chinese medicinal <span class="word low" data-lemma="herb" tabindex="-1">herbs</span>, and raising bees. She has been able to do this <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">due</span> to the development of ecological <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">compensation</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="policy" tabindex="-1">policies</span> that the Chinese have started.</p>
		<p>China has more than 3 807 km² of forests, which are now managed and protected by over 4 000 forest rangers. These rangers are able to work in their hometowns and better their families financially, and all this is done while protecting and managing the country's forests.</p>
		<p>Some rangers are also <span class="word high" data-lemma="task" tabindex="-1">tasked</span> with managing and protecting the grasslands and wetlands. This includes <span class="word high" data-lemma="check" tabindex="-1">checking</span> on the local grasslands and making sure that it is not <span class="word low" data-lemma="overload" tabindex="-1">overloaded</span> by cattle and sheep.</p>
		<p>In one province, public <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">welfare</span> jobs have been <span class="word high" data-lemma="create" tabindex="-1">created</span> for protecting and managing forestry and grassland <span class="word high" data-lemma="resource" tabindex="-1">resources</span>. The province has hired 49 900 <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">qualified</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span>-stricken <span class="word med" data-lemma="resident" tabindex="-1">residents</span> as rangers. This has increased their <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">income</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">considerably</span> and has <span class="word high" data-lemma="lift" tabindex="-1">lifted</span> the rangers and their families out of <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span>.</p>
		<p>The <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span> in China where forests and grassland <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span> have suffered <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">destruction</span> and are ecologically <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">vulnerable</span> are usually extremely impoverished <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span>. These are the <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span> where the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">worst</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span> is <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">found</span>, and these are the <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span> which are at the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">core</span> of the forest and grassland programmes.</p>
		<p>China's <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">deputy</span> head of the National Forestry and Grassland <span class="word high" data-lemma="administration" tabindex="-1">Administration</span>, Li Chunliang, said that the country has hired over 1.1 million <span class="word high" data-lemma="register" tabindex="-1">registered</span> poor villagers as rangers and that more that 3 million people in impoverished <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span> have been <span class="word high" data-lemma="lift" tabindex="-1">lifted</span> out of <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span>.</p>
		<p>The <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">area</span> of forest and grass <span class="word high" data-lemma="resource" tabindex="-1">resources</span> under management and protection has been increases by nearly 600 000 km² which has resulted in the increase of the locals' <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">income</span> and the protection of the <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">ecology</span>.</p>
		<p>A local villager and her <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">husband</span> in Tongliao city have planted a wood of <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">various</span> trees around their <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">house</span>. They did this after the government asked the people to help <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">restore</span> the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">sandy</span> land in that <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">area</span>. The <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">couple</span> <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">participate</span> in the afforestation <span class="word high" data-lemma="project" tabindex="-1">projects</span> every year by watering trees, digging holes for new trees, and levelling the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">ground</span> with a <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">tractor</span>. "As the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">sandy</span> land turns greener and grasslands are able to support more cattle, we have also <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">become</span> better-off," said the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">couple</span>.</p>
		<p>China has managed to alleviate <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">poverty</span> in <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">rural</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span> by <span class="word low" data-lemma="compensate" tabindex="-1">compensating</span> their rangers, as well as <span class="word med" data-lemma="restore" tabindex="-1">restoring</span> grasslands, wetlands, and forests by replanting and <span class="word med" data-lemma="monitor" tabindex="-1">monitoring</span> these <span class="word high" data-lemma="area" tabindex="-1">areas</span>.</p>
