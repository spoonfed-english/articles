		<p>Christmas is a time for giving gifts – to <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="partner" tabindex="-1">partners</span>, friends, family, or your <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">community</span>. It does not matter how much you paid for the gift; it is <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">commonly</span> believed that “it is the thought that <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="count" tabindex="-1">counts</span>.”</p>
		<p>One woman believed that it is the thought that <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="count" tabindex="-1">counts</span> until her relationship with her boyfriend <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">fell</span> <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">apart</span> over a Christmas gift.</p>
		<p>A month before Christmas she bought a <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">raffle</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">ticket</span> at her work and won a <span class="word ielts ielts-med" tabindex="-1">brand</span>-new Nintendo Switch. She thought that it would be a <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">perfect</span> gift for her boyfriend because he was considering buying one for himself. This was not the only gift that led to the demise of their relationship. She also made him two <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" data-lemma="candle" tabindex="-1">candles</span>, <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" data-lemma="scent" tabindex="-1">scented</span> with two of the <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-med" data-lemma="perfume" tabindex="-1">perfumes</span> that she often <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="wear" tabindex="-1">wears</span>, and he liked.</p>
		<p>The boyfriend was distraught over the <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">lack</span> of money she <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="spend" tabindex="-1">spent</span> on his gifts. He was also <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-med" tabindex="-1">upset</span> because she had given him only one ‘real’ gift and he had given her three. He said that he felt underappreciated.</p>
		<p>When he opened her gifts, he was excited about the Nintendo Switch but did not <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">seem</span> excited about the <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" data-lemma="candle" tabindex="-1">candles</span>. He <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-med" tabindex="-1">barely</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="glance" tabindex="-1">glanced</span> at them and did not even read the <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">note</span> she had <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-med" data-lemma="attach" tabindex="-1">attached</span> to each <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">candle</span>.</p>
		<p>She said, “I was confused because I thought the <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" data-lemma="candle" tabindex="-1">candles</span> were ‘real’ gifts.” I asked him what he considered as ‘real’ gifts. He said, “It is something you put money and thought into, and that it should not be something I could get if I just asked you for it.”</p>
		<p>“I was <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" data-lemma="offend" tabindex="-1">offended</span> and told him that the Nintendo must not be a ‘real’ gift as I did not pay for it but won it at a <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">raffle</span> at work.” He got <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-med" tabindex="-1">upset</span> and insinuated that I had left his gift ‘to the last <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">minute</span>.’</p>
		<p>Their relationship <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="seem" tabindex="-1">seems</span> to have ended since the gift <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">incident</span>. She has also returned the gift <span class="word ielts ielts-low" tabindex="-1">voucher</span> and <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">necklace</span> she had received from him.</p>
		<p>Would those gifts <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" tabindex="-1">offend</span> you?</p>
