		<p>The children's ages range only a few months old and 31. They have been in contact with, and visited two other large families - one family of 16 in Australia and another family of 13 in Scotland.</p>
		<p>Sue has been pregnant for 16-and-a-half years. Sue had her first baby at the age of 14 and her second child when she was 17.</p>
		<p>A family of this size is rare, so the parents have been searching for similar-sized families to chat to and befriend. They have found two big families – a family in Australia and one in Scotland.</p>
		<p>In 2016 the Radford’s went on holiday to Queensland, Australia, to meet the Bonells. The Bonells have 16 children whose ages are between 6 and 31.</p>
		<p>This meeting between the two families involved feeding 35 children – the Radford's at that stage had 19 children. The decided on a BBQ. Dad Noel who owns a pie shop in Britain, brought a gift of kangaroo pie for the family in Australia. Jenni Bonell said that they would not normally eat kangaroo pie but that they were willing to try it.</p>
		<p>They would like to visit the Bonells again, but with the pandemic and travelling restrictions, the two families are not sure when they will be able to meet in person again.</p>
		<p>The Radford's have however developed a friendship with the Hann family who live in Dundee in Scotland. Emma and Roy Hann, aged 50, are parents to 13 children, aged between 5 and 28. Ten of their children still live in the house with them.</p>
		<p>The two families have managed to go camping and are planning a camping holiday together.</p>
		<p>The Radford's live in a 10-bedroom Victorian house in Morecambe, Lancashire, England. They run a successful bakery which brings in an income of almost 50 000 pounds a year. The children are expected to work when they are old enough. The younger children help in the bakery.</p>
		<p>An estimated 30 000 pounds is spent in a year bringing up the family. This includes birthday budgets of 100 pounds each and spending no more than 250 pounds on each child.</p>
		<p>Bath and bedtimes are between 6 pm and 9pm and the parents go to bed by 10pm. Dad Noel must make an early start at the bakery in the mornings, as he must be back home to help take the children to school in his minivan which can seat 9 people.</p>
		<p>Is baby number 22 going to be their last baby? “Definitely,” says mom Sue.</p>
