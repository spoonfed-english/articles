		<p>The Radford's are England's largest family. They have 22 children altogether. The children's ages <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">range</span> from only a few months old to 31. Sue <span class="word high" data-lemma="reveal" tabindex="-1">revealed</span> that she has been <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">pregnant</span> for a total of 16-and-a-half years. She had her first baby at the age of 14 and her second baby when she was 17.</p>
		<p>A family of this size is <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">rare</span>, so the parents have been searching for <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">similar</span>-sized families to <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">chat</span> to and befriend. They have been in <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">contact</span> with and visited two other large families, one family of 16 in Australia and another family of 13 in Scotland.</p>
		<p>In 2016 the Radford's went on holiday to Queensland, Australia, to meet the Bonell family. They have 16 children whose ages <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">range</span> from between 6 to 31.</p>
		<p>This meeting between the two families <span class="word high" data-lemma="involve" tabindex="-1">involved</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="feed" tabindex="-1">feeding</span> 35 children – the Radford's at that stage had 19 children. The decided on a BBQ. Dad Noel who <span class="word high" data-lemma="own" tabindex="-1">owns</span> a pie shop in Britain, brought a gift of <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">kangaroo</span> pie for the family in Australia. Jenni Bonell said that they would not <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">normally</span> eat <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">kangaroo</span> pie but that they were willing to try it.</p>
		<p>They would like to visit the Bonell family again, but with the pandemic and travelling <span class="word med" data-lemma="restriction" tabindex="-1">restrictions</span>, the two families are not sure when they will be able to meet in person again.</p>
		<p>The Radford's have however developed a friendship with the Hann family who live in Dundee in Scotland. Emma and Roy Hann, aged 50, are parents to 13 children, aged between 5 and 28. Ten of their children still live in the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">house</span> with them.</p>
		<p>The two families have managed to go camping and are planning a camping holiday together.</p>
		<p>The Radford's live in a 10-bedroom Victorian <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">house</span> in Morecambe, Lancashire, England. They run a successful bakery which brings in an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">income</span> of almost 50 000 <span class="word high" data-lemma="pound" tabindex="-1">pounds</span> a year. The children are expected to work when they are old enough. The younger children help in the bakery.</p>
		<p>An <span class="word high" data-lemma="estimate" tabindex="-1">estimated</span> 30 000 <span class="word high" data-lemma="pound" tabindex="-1">pounds</span> is spent in a year bringing up the family. This includes birthday <span class="word high" data-lemma="budget" tabindex="-1">budgets</span> of 100 <span class="word high" data-lemma="pound" tabindex="-1">pounds</span> each and spending no more than 250 <span class="word high" data-lemma="pound" tabindex="-1">pounds</span> on each child at Christmas.</p>
		<p>Bath and bedtimes are between 6pm and 9pm and the parents go to bed by 10pm. Dad Noel must make an early start at the bakery in the mornings, as he must be back home to help take the children to school in his minivan which can seat 9 people.</p>
		<p>Is baby number 22 going to be their last baby? “<span class="word high" data-lemma="definitely" tabindex="-1">Definitely</span>,” says mom Sue.</p>
