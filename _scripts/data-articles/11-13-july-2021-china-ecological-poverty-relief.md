In China, the forestry and grassland bureaus have worked hard for nearly 10 years at alleviating the country' s poverty-stricken farmers through ecological compensation, forestation, and developing the ecological industry. They have actively practised the philosophy that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets." These bureaus have managed to reach all their goals to reduce poverty through ecological compensation and restoration. Over 20 million poor people have benefited from their policies.
One forest ranger in Yunnan province is often seen walking, in her local ethnic clothing, through the mountain forest. According to her, she has been able to take care of her family and has participated in under-forest industries such as planting black cardamom, growing traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, and raising bees. She has been able to do this due to the development of ecological compensation policies that the Chinese have started.
China has more than 3 807 km² of forests, which are now managed and protected by over 4 000 forest rangers. These rangers are able to work in their hometowns and better their families financially, and all this is done while protecting and managing the country's forests.
Some rangers are also tasked to manage and protect the grasslands and wetlands. This includes checking on the local grasslands and making sure that it is not overloaded by cattle and sheep. 
In one province, public welfare jobs have been created for protecting and managing forestry and grassland resources. The province has hired 49 900 qualified poverty-stricken residents as rangers. This has increased their income considerably and has lifted the rangers and their families out of poverty.
The areas in China where forests and grassland areas have suffered destruction and are ecologically vulnerable are usually extremely impoverished areas. These are the areas where the worst poverty is found, and these are the areas which are at the core of the forest and grassland programmes.
China's deputy head of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, Li Chunliang, said that the country has hired over 1.1 million registered poor villagers as rangers and that more that 3 million people in impoverished areas have been lifted out of poverty.
The area of forest and grass resources under management and protection has been increases by nearly 600 000 km² which has resulted in the increase of the local's income and the protection of the ecology.
A local villager and her husband in Tongliao city have planted a wood of various trees around their house. They did this after the government asked the people to help restore the sandy land in that area. The couple participate in the afforestation projects every year by planting and watering trees, digging holes for the trees, and levelling the ground with a tractor. "As the sandy land turns greener and grasslands are able to support more cattle, we have also become better-off," said the couple.
China has managed to alleviate poverty in rural areas by compensating their rangers, as well as restoring grasslands, wetlands, and forests by replanting and monitoring these areas.
