		<p>Cameron was street racing in 2018 and now he has been <span class="word high" data-lemma="sentence" tabindex="-1">sentenced</span> to 24 years in prison. Cameron's family has <span class="word high" data-lemma="challenge" tabindex="-1">challenged</span> the verdict and is waiting to hear from the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">court</span>. He <span class="word low" data-lemma="plead" tabindex="-1">pleaded</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">guilty</span> on two counts of vehicular manslaughter.</p>
		<p>How did social <span class="word high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">respond</span> to this? They sympathised with him!</p>
		<p>Thousands of people have added their names to an online <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">petition</span> in support of Cameron. It was <span class="word high" data-lemma="launch" tabindex="-1">launched</span> by Sonam Rajput, and 17 000 people <span class="word high" data-lemma="sign" tabindex="-1">signed</span> it within two days. Sonam asked people who think it is not right that Cameron was <span class="word high" data-lemma="sentence" tabindex="-1">sentenced</span> to 24 years in <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">jail</span>, to please <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sign</span> and share the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">petition</span>. The <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">petition</span> read, “He is very young. I humbly <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">request</span> all of you to please support my <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">petition</span> for him. We only live once. With your help we can <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">save</span> him, and we can get him another chance in <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">court</span>.”</p>
		<p>A video that was made in support of Cameron went viral and received 18.1 million views and 1.6 million likes. Internet users around the world are <span class="word med" data-lemma="divide" tabindex="-1">divided</span> on Cameron's sentencing. There are many people who think his <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sentence</span> is not <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">excessive</span> and that the judge made the right decision.</p>
		<p>Many people showed unreasonable support for him just because they thought he was <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">handsome</span> and looked ‘<span class="word high" tabindex="-1">innocent</span>.' They <span class="word med" data-lemma="justify" tabindex="-1">justified</span> what he did and called it an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>. It is up to us to decide whether or not racing in the street is an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>, and whether his actions were <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">responsible</span>.</p>
		<p>If Cameron were an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">average</span> looking young man, would he have gotten so much <span class="word high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">attention</span>, or is it only because of his looks? Did people on social <span class="word high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span> read all the details of what had <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">actually</span> happened, or did they make a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">judgement</span> after only seeing pictures of him?</p>
		<p>If we look at what happened in 1979 with Ted Bundy, the <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">notorious</span> serial killer, we see that sympathising with <span class="word high" data-lemma="criminal" tabindex="-1">criminals</span> is not something new.</p>
		<p>While Ted was on <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">trial</span>, several women sent him fan mail and he even got marriage <span class="word high" data-lemma="proposal" tabindex="-1">proposals</span>. Ted had killed over 30 women, and he still got <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">sympathy</span> and support from his ‘fans.'</p>
		<p>After learning all the facts of Cameron's case, do you think it is fair for people to sympathise with him? Do you think the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sentence</span> is <span class="word med" data-lemma="justify" tabindex="-1">justified</span>, or is he being punished for an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span> that he had no control over?</p>
