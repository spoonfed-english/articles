		<p>Most people think that leopards are only found in Africa, but these predators can be found in many different countries and habitats. The Amur River runs along the eastern Russian and northern Chinese borders and these spotted cats are to be found in the mountainous forests in both countries, with the Amur River running through them.</p>
		<p>This is a harsh environment, and the Amur leopards are very well adapted to the bitter cold and snowy conditions. They have large paws that allows them to walk in the snow without sinking and their fur is exceptionally soft and dense to keep them dry and warm.</p>
		<p>Although the Amur leopard weighs between 35 - 40kg which is 10 - 15kg less than the African leopard, they can still take down prey that is up to three times their size. They prefer to eat deer and boar but will also eat rabbits and mice if they cannot find anything bigger. As they are so good at sneaking up on their prey, scientist sometimes call them the "silent killers".</p>
		<p>Amur leopards have become one of the rarest wild cats, due to poaching and loss of habitat. They are also the world's rarest leopards. In the early 2000s there were only about 30 of these leopards left. A new national park established along the Russian and Chinese border has helped the Amur leopard population to grow to about 80 leopards in 2018. This Park is known as the Land of the Leopard National Park and was created in 2012.</p>
		<p>It is believed by officials that effective law enforcement in the park will help to increase the number of Amur leopards, and soon even more of these leopards will be seen.</p>
