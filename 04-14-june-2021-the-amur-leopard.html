		<p>The Amur River runs <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">along</span> the eastern Russian and northern Chinese <span class="word high" data-lemma="border" tabindex="-1">borders</span> and these <span class="word high" data-lemma="spot" tabindex="-1">spotted</span> cats are to be <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">found</span> in the mountainous forests in both countries, with the Amur River running through them.</p>
		<p>This is a <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">harsh</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">environment</span>, and the Amur <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span> are very well adapted to the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">bitter</span> cold and snowy <span class="word high" data-lemma="condition" tabindex="-1">conditions</span>. They have large paws that allows them to walk in the snow without <span class="word med" data-lemma="sink" tabindex="-1">sinking</span> and their fur is exceptionally soft and <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">dense</span> to keep them dry and warm.</p>
		<p>Although the Amur <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">leopard</span> weighs between 35 - 40kg which is 10 - 15kg less than the African <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">leopard</span>, they can still take down <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">prey</span> that is up to three times their size. They prefer to eat deer and boar but will also eat rabbits and mice if they cannot find anything bigger. As they are so good at <span class="word low" data-lemma="sneak" tabindex="-1">sneaking</span> up on their <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">prey</span>, scientist sometimes call them the "silent killers".</p>
		<p>Amur <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span> have <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">become</span> one of the <span class="word high" data-lemma="rare" tabindex="-1">rarest</span> wild cats, <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">due</span> to poaching and loss of habitat. They are also the world's <span class="word high" data-lemma="rare" tabindex="-1">rarest</span> <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span>. In the early 2000s there were only about 30 of these <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span> left. A new national park <span class="word high" data-lemma="establish" tabindex="-1">established</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">along</span> the Russian and Chinese <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">border</span> has helped the Amur <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">leopard</span> population to grow to about 80 <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span> in 2018. This Park is known as the Land of the <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">Leopard</span> National Park and was <span class="word high" data-lemma="create" tabindex="-1">created</span> in 2012.</p>
		<p>It is believed by officials that <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">effective</span> law enforcement in the park will help to increase the number of Amur <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span>, and soon even more of these <span class="word low" data-lemma="leopard" tabindex="-1">leopards</span> will be seen.</p>
