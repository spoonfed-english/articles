	<section class="text">
		<p>Almost 3 years after the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">incident</span>, a judge <span class="word high" data-lemma="sentence" tabindex="-1">sentenced</span> Cameron Herrin, aged 21, to 24 years in a state prison. Cameron sped <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">along</span> Bayshore Boulevard and <span class="word med" data-lemma="crash" tabindex="-1">crashed</span> into a mother and daughter, killing both.</p>
		<p>Judge Christopher Nash's decision came at the end of a long day of <span class="word low" data-lemma="testimony" tabindex="-1">testimonies</span>. These <span class="word low" data-lemma="testimony" tabindex="-1">testimonies</span> were from family members taking the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">witness</span> stand to talk about Cameron's <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">character</span>. The victims' family members then had an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">opportunity</span> to voice their heartbreak and <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">rage</span> at the damage that the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span> had done to their lives.</p>
		<p>Cameron appeared wide-eyed as the judge <span class="word low" data-lemma="announce" tabindex="-1">announced</span> his <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sentence</span>. When the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">deputy</span> cuffed him, members of his family began to cry.</p>
		<p>Cameron's mom, Cheryl, said that while he was still at the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">scene</span> of the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>, he called her and told her that he had been in an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>. She <span class="word low" data-lemma="testify" tabindex="-1">testified</span> that Cameron had been crying while talking to her.</p>
		<p>He said, “Mom. I've killed someone.” She replied, “No Cameron, you're mistaken.”</p>
		<p>She drove to the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">scene</span> of the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>, staying on the phone with Cameron all the time. She saw the Ford Mustang, a gift from her and her <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">husband</span> when Cameron <span class="word low" data-lemma="graduate" tabindex="-1">graduated</span> from High School two days <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">prior</span> to the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>. When she arrived at the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">scene</span>, Cameron was on his hands and knees on the grassy median.</p>
		<p>Last year Cameron <span class="word low" data-lemma="plead" tabindex="-1">pleaded</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">guilty</span> to two counts of vehicular homicide for the deaths of Jessica Reisinger-Raubenolt and her 1-year-old daughter, Lillia.</p>
		<p>Cameron's mother said she felt <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">responsible</span> for the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>, and, if it were possible, she would accept his <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sentence</span>.</p>
		<p>That afternoon, after the judge had heard Cameron's family's <span class="word low" data-lemma="testimony" tabindex="-1">testimonies</span>, the victims' family was called to the stand. Pamela Reisinger said that the Herrin family could comfort and <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">hug</span> their children, but all her family could do is look at photos. She says she goes to the <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">closet</span> and smells an <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">item</span> of their clothing for comfort.</p>
		<p>Jessica's brother-in-law asked Cameron, “Do you know what it is like to <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">whisper</span> into a dying toddler's ear “I <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">promise</span> I will always take care of your dad?” .... You did this to us, Cameron. You killed them.”</p>
		<p>On the morning of May 23, 2018, Cameron and his friend, John Barrineau, drove to the local gym to work out. His older brother, Tristan, went with him as a passenger in the Mustang. John drove in his <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">own</span> car, a gold Nissan.</p>
		<p>They stopped at a traffic <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">light</span> then sped north on Bayshore Boulevard. Drivers and bystanders later told the police that it appeared as if the two cars were having a race. The two cars were sometimes <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">parallel</span> to each other as they <span class="word high" data-lemma="shift" tabindex="-1">shifted</span> between the two <span class="word high" data-lemma="lane" tabindex="-1">lanes</span>.</p>
		<p>That fateful morning, Jessica, who was pushing Lillia in her stroller, was walking <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">along</span> Bayshore Boulevard to a relative's home. At the intersection she started to cross the roadway.</p>
		<p><span class="word low" data-lemma="accord" tabindex="-1">According</span> to a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">witness</span>, John in his Nissan, swerved to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">avoid</span> Jessica and Lillia. Cameron, in his Mustang, swerved to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">avoid</span> the Nissan and <span class="word med" data-lemma="crash" tabindex="-1">crashed</span> into Jessica and Lillia.</p>
		<p><span class="word high" data-lemma="assistant" tabindex="-1">Assistant</span> State <span class="word low" data-lemma="attorney" tabindex="-1">Attorney</span> Aaron Hubbard, <span class="word high" data-lemma="present" tabindex="-1">presented</span> to the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">court</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">data</span> from the Mustang's <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">navigation</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">system</span>. It showed <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">multiple</span> speeding <span class="word high" data-lemma="incident" tabindex="-1">incidents</span> in the days before the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span>. On May 18, a speed of 100 mph was recorded. On May 22, the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">data</span> showed that he had been speeding at 84 mph <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">along</span> Bayshore Boulevard. The speed limit at the time of the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span> on Bayshore Boulevard was 45 mph.</p>
		<p>On May 23, <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">data</span> showed that the Mustang was driving at 100 mph moments before <span class="word med" data-lemma="crash" tabindex="-1">crashing</span> into Jessica and Lillia. A Tampa police <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">detective</span> <span class="word low" data-lemma="testify" tabindex="-1">testified</span> that the car was moving between 30 and 40 mph at <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">impact</span>.</p>
		<p>David Raubenolt, Jessica's <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">husband</span> and Lillia's father, spoke for about an hour. He told the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">court</span> of the loss he has <span class="word low" data-lemma="endure" tabindex="-1">endured</span>. He also said that as he was driving towards the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">house</span> where they were staying, he saw the traffic backed up. He prayed that it was a stranger and not somebody he knew.</p>
		<p>He spoke about his wife, who loved children and had natural parenting skills. She was the kind of person who would give <span class="word high" data-lemma="note" tabindex="-1">notes</span> to the other passengers on an aeroplane, apologising if Lillia was to cry. She had studied nutrition at college and believed that a good <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">diet</span> is important to the family's health.</p>
		<p>He said that the loss of his wife and daughter was a loss to the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">community</span>, where candlelight vigils were <span class="word high" data-lemma="hold" tabindex="-1">held</span> in their honour.</p>
		<p>The victim's family said they all wanted Cameron to get the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">maximum</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sentence</span>.</p>
		<p>Cheryl said her family suffered as well. She said, “Both my sons see the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span> play over and over and over.” They both have <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">anxiety</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="attack" tabindex="-1">attacks</span> and <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">panic</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="attack" tabindex="-1">attacks</span>, and that she hears screams from both boys at night.</p>
		<p>Cameron has <span class="word high" data-lemma="lose" tabindex="-1">lost</span> weight and has sleepless nights. He also went to a therapist for help.</p>
		<p>Tampa, the city in which they live, was captivated by the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">tragedy</span> in a way local crimes seldom do. The <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">stretch</span> of road where the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">accident</span> happened is regarded as symbolic of the city itself, with million-dollar <span class="word low" data-lemma="mansion" tabindex="-1">mansions</span> on one side, and the ocean on the other. Bayshore Boulevard is <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">popular</span> for its walkers, runners, cyclists, and skaters.</p>
		<p>Many people on social <span class="word high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span> showed unreasonable support for Cameron because of his appearance, which has <span class="word high" data-lemma="cause" tabindex="-1">caused</span> some <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">controversy</span> online and in social <span class="word high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span>.
