		<p>Dean is 32 years old and had worked as a welder in a fish factory.</p>
		<p>After a few months of cycling, he reached Bosnia. While <span class="word high" data-lemma="cycle" tabindex="-1">cycling</span> there he noticed a tiny grey and white kitten running after him. He got off his bicycle and <span class="word high" data-lemma="feed" tabindex="-1">fed</span> her red pesto <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">sauce</span> from his food supplies.</p>
		<p>He decided to take her to a vet in the nearest town. This was to find out whether anyone had <span class="word high" data-lemma="lose" tabindex="-1">lost</span> their kitten. At the vet, nobody knew who the kitten belonged to.</p>
		<p>Dean put her into the basket at the front of his bicycle and decided to take her with him on his cycling <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">adventure</span>. Now the kitten had to have a name, so he called her Nala. He then made space on his bicycle for toys, a <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">harness</span>, and a <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">doll</span>-sized umbrella for Nala.</p>
		<p>Nala tried to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">escape</span> out of the basket, but she did not run away. She only wanted a more comfortable space to sit. What Nala did to be comfortable made Dean decide to take her with on his <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">adventure</span> - she climbed up Dean's arm and <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">fell</span> asleep on his shoulder behind his neck. Dean said, "That is when I <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">fell</span> in love with her. "</p>
		<p>He said "Having her opens up so many <span class="word high" data-lemma="conversation" tabindex="-1">conversations</span> with people. It is a talking point."</p>
		<p>Dean and Nala spent their first winter together in Santorini, a Greek island where he worked as a kayak guide. Here he discovered that Nala also enjoyed being in a kayak on the water. The first time she went with him, she jumped into to kayak and sat while he paddled.</p>
		<p>After Greece they biked through Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Dean wanted to go to Iran but, because of the <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">tense</span> political situation and cats not being allowed in hotel rooms, they had to turn back.</p>
		<p>During the corona <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">virus</span> pandemic, they stayed in Hungary for twelve weeks. During this time, Dean wrote his book about his and Nala's <span class="word med" data-lemma="adventure" tabindex="-1">adventures</span>. The book is called "Nala’s World: One Man, His <span class="word med" data-lemma="rescue" tabindex="-1">Rescue</span> Cat, and a Bike Ride Around the <span class="word low" data-lemma="globe" tabindex="-1">Globe</span>."</p>
		<p>They went to Austria where they are staying until travel <span class="word med" data-lemma="restriction" tabindex="-1">restrictions</span> are <span class="word high" data-lemma="lift" tabindex="-1">lifted</span>. Dean wants to go to Russia and <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">eventually</span> Thailand. The reason Dean wants to go to Thailand is to drink from a coconut. Now he will have to order one for Nala as well. He said, “She might like coconut, but if she does not, then I will find her some cat <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">milk</span>."</p>
