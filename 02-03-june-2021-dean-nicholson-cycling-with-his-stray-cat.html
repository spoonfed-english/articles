		<p>Dean is 32 years old and had worked as a welder in a fish <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">factory</span>.</p>
		<p>After a few months of cycling, he <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="reach" tabindex="-1">reached</span> Bosnia. While <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" data-lemma="cycle" tabindex="-1">cycling</span> there he noticed a <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">tiny</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">grey</span> and white <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">kitten</span> running after him. He got off his <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">bicycle</span> and <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="feed" tabindex="-1">fed</span> her red pesto <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-med" tabindex="-1">sauce</span> from his food supplies.</p>
		<p>He <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">decided</span> to take her to a vet in the nearest town. This was to find out whether anyone had <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" data-lemma="lose" tabindex="-1">lost</span> their <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">kitten</span>. At the vet, <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">nobody</span> knew who the <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">kitten</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" data-lemma="belong" tabindex="-1">belonged</span> to.</p>
		<p>Dean put her into the basket at the front of his <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">bicycle</span> and <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">decided</span> to take her with him on his cycling <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-high" tabindex="-1">adventure</span>. Now the <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">kitten</span> had to have a name, so he called her Nala. He then made space on his <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">bicycle</span> for <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="toy" tabindex="-1">toys</span>, a <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" tabindex="-1">harness</span>, and a <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-high" tabindex="-1">doll</span>-sized <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">umbrella</span> for Nala.</p>
		<p>Nala tried to <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">escape</span> out of the basket, but she did not run away. She only wanted a more <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">comfortable</span> space to <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">sit</span>. What Nala did to be <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">comfortable</span> made Dean <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">decide</span> to take her with on his <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-high" tabindex="-1">adventure</span> - she <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" data-lemma="climb" tabindex="-1">climbed</span> up Dean's <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">arm</span> and <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">fell</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">asleep</span> on his <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">shoulder</span> behind his <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">neck</span>. Dean said, "That is when I <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">fell</span> in love with her. "</p>
		<p>He said "Having her opens up so many <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" data-lemma="conversation" tabindex="-1">conversations</span> with people. It is a talking point."</p>
		<p>Dean and Nala <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="spend" tabindex="-1">spent</span> their first winter together in Santorini, a <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="greek" tabindex="-1">Greek</span> island where he worked as a kayak guide. Here he <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="discover" tabindex="-1">discovered</span> that Nala also enjoyed being in a kayak on the water. The first time she went with him, she jumped into to kayak and <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="sit" tabindex="-1">sat</span> while he <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" data-lemma="paddle" tabindex="-1">paddled</span>.</p>
		<p>After Greece they <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="bike" tabindex="-1">biked</span> through <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="turkey" tabindex="-1">Turkey</span>, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Dean wanted to go to Iran but, because of the <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" tabindex="-1">tense</span> political situation and cats not being allowed in hotel rooms, they had to turn back.</p>
		<p>During the corona <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-high" tabindex="-1">virus</span> pandemic, they stayed in Hungary for <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">twelve</span> weeks. During this time, Dean wrote his book about his and Nala's <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-high" data-lemma="adventure" tabindex="-1">adventures</span>. The book is called "Nala's World: One Man, His <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-high" data-lemma="rescue" tabindex="-1">Rescue</span> Cat, and a <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="bike" tabindex="-1">Bike</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="ride" tabindex="-1">Ride</span> Around the <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-high" data-lemma="globe" tabindex="-1">Globe</span>."</p>
		<p>They went to Austria where they are staying until travel <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-med" data-lemma="restriction" tabindex="-1">restrictions</span> are <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" data-lemma="lift" tabindex="-1">lifted</span>. Dean wants to go to Russia and <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">eventually</span> Thailand. The reason Dean wants to go to Thailand is to <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">drink</span> from a <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">coconut</span>. Now he will have to order one for Nala as well. He said, “She might like <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">coconut</span>, but if she does not, then I will find her some cat <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">milk</span>."</p>
