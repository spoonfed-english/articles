		<p>Jamie, 27, met Nolte, 43, when she was visiting her friend Nikita, in 2007. Now after all this time they are finally together and are <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="expect" tabindex="-1">expecting</span> a baby.</p>
		<p>Jamie says, “It was love at first <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">sight</span>, <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">despite</span> the age <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">gap</span>.” It was not until December 2020 when they met up again and their <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">friendship</span> started <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" data-lemma="blossom" tabindex="-1">blossoming</span>.</p>
		<p>Jamie tells us that she was 12 in 2007 when she met Nolte. He was 27 years old at the time. She did not let him know how she felt about him, and he did not say how he felt about her.</p>
		<p>She added, “I <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="become" tabindex="-1">became</span> friends with his <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">niece</span> Nikita, and ever since then I have had a <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" tabindex="-1">crush</span> on her <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">cute</span> <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">uncle</span>. For me it was love at first <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">sight</span> and I knew he was going to be ‘the one.’ I made the first move in 2017 before I went <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">abroad</span>. On this <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-med" tabindex="-1">occasion</span> I told him that I was going to <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">marry</span> him one day, even though I knew he was in a relationship at that stage. He thought it was a <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">joke</span> and <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" data-lemma="laugh" tabindex="-1">laughed</span>, not taking me <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">seriously</span> at all. Little did he know how <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">serious</span> I was, and that I knew we would <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">eventually</span> be together.</p>
		<p>In 2019 Jamie returned to her hometown after two years <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">abroad</span>. Nolte was working as a beekeeper and had been following Jamie on her social <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span> pages. He was apprehensive about their age <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">gap</span> and did not want to <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">contact</span> her. He finally <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">decided</span> to <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">contact</span> Jamie <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">via</span> social <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span>, after which they <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="spend" tabindex="-1">spent</span> months just <span class="word ielts ielts-med" data-lemma="chat" tabindex="-1">chatting</span> and not meeting in person.</p>
		<p>Then one day he <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">decided</span> to visit Jamie at the <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">bar</span> where she was working. He <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="walk" tabindex="-1">walked</span> in and gave her a big <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" tabindex="-1">hug</span>. The very next day her friend Nikita <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-med" data-lemma="arrange" tabindex="-1">arranged</span> a wine tasting <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">date</span> for them. After that <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">date</span>, during which they also had their first <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">kiss</span>, their relationship developed <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">quickly</span>.</p>
		<p>They have been very open about their relationship. Nolte’s parents were <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" data-lemma="shock" tabindex="-1">shocked</span> at <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="discover" tabindex="-1">discovering</span> their son’s relationship with their <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">granddaughter</span>’s best friend. Jamie says, “My parents were a bit shocked because we made it public on social <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span> before telling them. They accepted it easily as they have known him for many years and had always liked him.”</p>
		<p>Nikita was <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">extremely</span> excited about their relationship. She had been <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="root" tabindex="-1">rooting</span> for them since she <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">found</span> out that Jamie had a <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-low cet6-low" tabindex="-1">crush</span> on her <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">uncle</span>. She is also the person that helped Jamie and Nolte get together.</p>
		<p>Jamie had a <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">secret</span> relationship before she started <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="date" tabindex="-1">dating</span> Nolte. The man was 30 years her senior, but he <span class="word cet6 cet6-low" tabindex="-1">sadly</span> passed away. Nolte was <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">married</span> for five years when he was in his <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="twenty" tabindex="-1">twenties</span> and got <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-high" data-lemma="divorce" tabindex="-1">divorced</span> a few years ago.</p>
		<p>Jamie <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="explain" tabindex="-1">explains</span> why the age <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">gap</span> between them is working so well. “He knows what he wants and is past the ‘<span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-med" data-lemma="mess" tabindex="-1">messing</span> around’ stage in his life. He is more committed when it comes to love and starting a family. We understand each other and are <span class="word cet6 cet6-med" tabindex="-1">honest</span> with each other.”</p>
		<p>They are giving advice to other <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="couple" tabindex="-1">couples</span> who are also in ‘age <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">gap</span>’ relationships. “Do not let anyone tell you what is right or what is wrong when it comes to love and age. Never <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">focus</span> on age, it is <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-med cet6-med" tabindex="-1">literally</span> just a number. If it feels right, then it is right. <span class="word ielts ielts-high" data-lemma="focus" tabindex="-1">Focus</span> on yourself – it is your life, and you must live it. Love who you want, and you will live a happy life,” says Jamie.</p>
		<p>Nolte is <span class="word ielts ielts-high" tabindex="-1">currently</span> working on a farm <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">abroad</span> but will be back for the <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">birth</span> of their child.</p>
		<p>Jamie and Nolte have been in a <span class="word ielts cet6 ielts-high cet6-high" tabindex="-1">serious</span> relationship for <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" tabindex="-1">nearly</span> a year and are <span class="word cet6 cet6-high" data-lemma="expect" tabindex="-1">expecting</span> their first child in a few months' time.</p>
