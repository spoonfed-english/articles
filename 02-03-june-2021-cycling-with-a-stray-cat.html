		<p>Dean is 32 years old and had worked as a welder in a fish factory.</p>
		<p>After a few months of cycling, he reached Bosnia. While cycling there he noticed a tiny grey and white kitten running after him. He got off his bicycle and fed her red pesto sauce from his food supplies.</p>
		<p>He decided to take her to a vet in the nearest town. This was to find out whether anyone had lost their kitten. At the vet, nobody knew who the kitten belonged to.</p>
		<p>Dean put her into the basket at the front of his bicycle and decided to take her with him on his cycling adventure. Now the kitten had to have a name, so he called her Nala. He then made space on his bicycle for toys, a harness, and a doll-sized umbrella for Nala.</p>
		<p>Nala tried to escape out of the basket, but she did not run away. She only wanted a more comfortable space to sit. What Nala did to be comfortable made Dean decide to take her with on his adventure - she climbed up Dean's arm and fell asleep on his shoulder behind his neck. Dean said, "That is when I fell in love with her. "</p>
		<p>He said "Having her opens up so many conversations with people. It is a talking point."</p>
		<p>Dean and Nala spent their first winter together in Santorini, a Greek island where he worked as a kayak guide. Here he discovered that Nala also enjoyed being in a kayak on the water. The first time she went with him, she jumped into to kayak and sat while he paddled.</p>
		<p>After Greece they biked through Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Dean wanted to go to Iran but, because of the tense political situation and cats not being allowed in hotel rooms, they had to turn back.</p>
		<p>During the corona virus pandemic, they stayed in Hungary for twelve weeks. During this time, Dean wrote his book about his and Nala's adventures. The book is called "Nala’s World: One Man, His Rescue Cat, and a Bike Ride Around the Globe."</p>
		<p>They went to Austria where they are staying until travel restrictions are lifted. Dean wants to go to Russia and eventually Thailand. The reason Dean wants to go to Thailand is to drink from a coconut. Now he will have to order one for Nala as well. He said, “She might like coconut, but if she does not, then I will find her some cat milk."</p>
