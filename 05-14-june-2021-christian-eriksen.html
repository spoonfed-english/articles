		<p>Erikson, who is 29 years old, suffered cardiac <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">arrest</span> during the first half of the Group B <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">fixture</span>.</p>
		<p>He was quickly <span class="word high" data-lemma="attend" tabindex="-1">attended</span> to by the medics, who ran to his <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">aid</span> when he <span class="word high" data-lemma="collapse" tabindex="-1">collapsed</span>. They put him on a stretcher after treating him on the field. He was then taken to hospital where his <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">condition</span> was stabilised.</p>
		<p>The Danish FA said on Sunday morning, that Eriksen had been in touch with his teammates and that he would be kept in hospital to be <span class="word med" data-lemma="monitor" tabindex="-1">monitored</span>. At a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">press</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">conference</span> on Sunday afternoon, they <span class="word high" data-lemma="address" tabindex="-1">addressed</span> the public at Parken in Copenhagen. Denmark's sporting director Peter Moller, <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">team</span> doctor Morten Boesen and head <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">coach</span> Kasper Hjulmand were all at the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">press</span> <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">conference</span>.</p>
		<p>"We don't have an explanation for what happened," <span class="word high" data-lemma="comment" tabindex="-1">commented</span> Boesen. "I didn't see it live; I saw it on the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">screen</span> after it happened. You have seen the same as me, but there's no explanation so far."</p>
		<p>Apparently "he was gone," and had to be given cardiac resuscitation.</p>
		<p>Tim Meyer has <span class="word med" data-lemma="insist" tabindex="-1">insisted</span> that medical <span class="word high" data-lemma="check" tabindex="-1">checks</span> be done on Eriksen, to look for <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">underlying</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="condition" tabindex="-1">conditions</span>.</p>
		<p>Meyer told reporters: "Fundamentally, we and other nations, follow two <span class="word high" data-lemma="strategy" tabindex="-1">strategies</span>:”</p>
		<p>1. "We examine our players regularly for <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">underlying</span> health <span class="word high" data-lemma="issue" tabindex="-1">issues</span>. The DFB does this comprehensively and I <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">presume</span> that the Danish FA does too. "</p>
		<p>2.  "When such cases <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">occur</span>, it is <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">vital</span> that those <span class="word high" data-lemma="involve" tabindex="-1">involved</span> are able to take the right steps. Doctors and trained medical <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">personnel</span> are on standby."</p>
		<p>He also said that there are always two defibrillators, in case the one fails. They are very well prepared for <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">various</span> medical <span class="word high" data-lemma="emergency" tabindex="-1">emergencies</span> that may <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">occur</span> on the playing field.</p>
		<p>He personally does not think that the DFB need take <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">further</span> action, as the official <span class="word med" data-lemma="recommendation" tabindex="-1">recommendations</span> were <span class="word low" data-lemma="adhere" tabindex="-1">adhered</span> to.</p>
