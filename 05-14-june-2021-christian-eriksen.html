		<p>Erikson, who is 29 years old, suffered cardiac arrest during the first half of the Group B fixture. </p>
		<p>He was quickly attended to by the medics, who ran to his aid when he collapsed. They put him on a stretcher after treating him on the field. He was then taken to hospital where his condition was stabilised.</p>
		<p>The Danish FA said on Sunday morning, that Eriksen had been in touch with his teammates and that he would be kept in hospital to be monitored. At a press conference on Sunday afternoon, they addressed the public at Parken in Copenhagen. Denmark's sporting director Peter Moller, team doctor Morten Boesen and head coach Kasper Hjulmand were all at the press conference.</p>
		<p>"We don't have an explanation for what happened," commented Boesen. "I didn't see it live; I saw it on the screen after it happened. You have seen the same as me, but there's no explanation so far."</p>
		<p>Apparently "he was gone," and had to be given cardiac resuscitation. </p>
		<p>Tim Meyer has insisted that medical checks be done on Eriksen, to look for underlying conditions.</p>
		<p>Meyer told reporters: "Fundamentally, we and other nations, follow two strategies:”</p>
		<p> 1. "We examine our players regularly for underlying health issues. The DFB does this comprehensively and I presume that the Danish FA does too. "</p>
		<p> 2.  "When such cases occur, it is vital that those involved are able to take the right steps. Doctors and trained medical personnel are on standby."</p>
		<p>He also said that there are always two defibrillators, in case the one fails. They are very well prepared for various medical emergencies that may occur on the playing field. </p>
		<p>He personally does not think that the DFB need take further action, as the official recommendations were adhered to.</p>
