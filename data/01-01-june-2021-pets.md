A survey by US veterinary group, Banfield Pet Hospital, shows the effects that lockdown has had on pets and their owners.
The study shows that the bond between people and their pets can help us through difficult times in our lives. Owning a pet is also good for our health.
Taking our dogs for walks mean that we can exercise, be outside and meet other people. Taking our dogs for walks and playing with them can decrease blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Having a pet as a companion can help manage depression and loneliness.
October is Mental Awareness Month. The aim of Mental Awareness Month is to educate the public about mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress. Being under lockdown, and not being able to see friends and family because of the pandemic, has escalated these problems for many people.
Pets lower stress and reduce unhappiness. Stroking your pet can make you feel calmer and ease tense muscles. Playing with your pet also increases the levels of the feel-good hormones in your brain.
Pets are aware of humans' moods, like when we are unhappy, sad, depressed, or happy. Caring for our pets reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. They keep us company and add joy to our lives.
