Most people cannot travel to the Louvre to see its art works. The Louvre only has a small part of their art collection on display in the museum. There are more than 480 000 artworks in the museum.
This has now changed. If you have internet, and a smartphone or computer, you can view all their artworks, whenever you want, from any place in the world. The Louvre has recently launched a new online database that displays its entire collection. This database also includes art from the Musee National Eugene Delacroix, sculptures from the Louvre's Tuileries, and the Carrousel gardens, and works from the National Museums Recovery program.
Items from the National Museums Recovery program are items that were looted by the Nazis and reclaimed by the French after World War II. The Louvre has been working at finding the real owners to return these items to them.
The database, that will be updated on a regular basis, will allow people to see artworks in storage, on display, and on loan to other institutions.
This will be the first time that anyone can access their entire collection. Even the less known pieces can be seen. The Louvre president-director, Jean-Luc Martinez said, "I am sure that this digital content is going to further inspire people to come to the Louvre to discover the collections in person."
Due to Covid-19, the Louvre is still closed, so the only way to see the artworks is by viewing them online.
