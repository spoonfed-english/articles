		<p>The <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">date</span> was April 15, 1912. This <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">disaster</span> killed more than 1 500 passengers.</p>
		<p>Auroras shimmered in skies over the northern Atlantic that night. An observer <span class="word low" data-lemma="testify" tabindex="-1">testified</span> that the northern <span class="word high" data-lemma="light" tabindex="-1">lights</span> (the auroras) were very strong, and eyewitnesses described <span class="word low" data-lemma="glow" tabindex="-1">glows</span> in the sky as the Titanic went down. New <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">research</span> <span class="word med" data-lemma="hint" tabindex="-1">hints</span> that the storm behind the northern <span class="word high" data-lemma="light" tabindex="-1">lights</span> could have disrupted the ship's <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">navigation</span> and <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">communication</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="system" tabindex="-1">systems</span>. It might even have <span class="word low" data-lemma="hamper" tabindex="-1">hampered</span> <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">rescue</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="effort" tabindex="-1">efforts</span>.</p>
		<p>When high-speed streams of electrified gas shoot down to Earth from the sun, it is called a <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solar</span> storm. Auroras form from <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solar</span> storms. These <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solar</span> storms <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">create</span> a lot of <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">energy</span> when they <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">collide</span> with Earth’s <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">atmosphere</span>. This <span class="word high" data-lemma="cause" tabindex="-1">causes</span> them to <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">glow</span> green, red, <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">purple</span>, and blue.</p>
		<p>If a <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solar</span> storm was powerful enough to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">produce</span> an aurora, it may have <span class="word high" data-lemma="affect" tabindex="-1">affected</span> <span class="word low" data-lemma="compass" tabindex="-1">compasses</span> and wireless <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">communication</span> on the Titanic. It would also have <span class="word high" data-lemma="affect" tabindex="-1">affected</span> other ships in the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">area</span> that tried to come to the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">rescue</span> of the Titanic.</p>
		<p><span class="word low" data-lemma="accord" tabindex="-1">According</span> to James Bisset, of the RMS Carpathia, there was no moon, but the Aurora <span class="word low" data-lemma="glitter" tabindex="-1">glittered</span> in the sky. The Carpathia was used in the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">rescue</span> of the <span class="word low" data-lemma="survivor" tabindex="-1">survivors</span> of the Titanic.</p>
		<p>The northern <span class="word high" data-lemma="light" tabindex="-1">lights</span> were also seen by the <span class="word low" data-lemma="survivor" tabindex="-1">survivors</span> from their lifeboats at around 3 a.m. Lawrence Beesley, a Titanic <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">survivor</span>, wrote that the <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">glow</span> "arched fanwise <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">across</span> the northern sky, with <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">faint</span> streamers reaching towards the <span class="word med" data-lemma="pole" tabindex="-1">Pole</span>-star."</p>
		<p>While the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solar</span> storm was <span class="word med" data-lemma="generate" tabindex="-1">generating</span> a beautiful <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">light</span> in the sky, it could have also been disrupting the Titanic's <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">compass</span>. A <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">mere</span> 0.5 degrees would have been enough for the Titanic to go off-course and place it on a course where it <span class="word low" data-lemma="collide" tabindex="-1">collided</span> with the iceberg.</p>
		<p>It is <span class="word med" data-lemma="propose" tabindex="-1">proposed</span>, that if the disruption from a <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solar</span> storm did take place, it could have <span class="word high" data-lemma="influence" tabindex="-1">influenced</span> <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">distress</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="signal" tabindex="-1">signals</span> that were sent out from the Titanic. This would have <span class="word high" data-lemma="delay" tabindex="-1">delayed</span> the arrival of any <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">rescue</span> ships.</p>
