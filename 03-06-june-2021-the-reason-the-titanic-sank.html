		<p>The date was April 15, 1912. This disaster killed more than 1500 passengers.</p>
		<p>Auroras shimmered in skies over the northern Atlantic that night. An observer testified that the northern lights (the auroras) were very strong, and eyewitnesses described glows in the sky as the Titanic went down. New </p>research hints that the storm behind the northern lights could have disrupted the ship's navigation and communication systems. It might even have hampered rescue efforts.
		<p>When high-speed streams of electrified gas shoot down to Earth from the sun, it is called a solar storm. Auroras form from solar storms. These solar storms create a lot of energy when they collide with Earth’s </p>atmosphere. This causes them to glow green, red, purple, and blue.
		<p>If a solar storm was powerful enough to produce an aurora, it may have affected compasses and wireless communication on the Titanic. It would also have affected other ships in the area that tried to come to the rescue </p>of the Titanic.
		<p>According to James Bisset, of the RMS Carpathia, there was no moon, but the Aurora glittered like in the sky. The Carpathia was used in the rescue of the survivors of the Titanic.</p>
		<p>The northern lights were also seen by the survivors from their lifeboats at around 3 a.m. Lawrence Beesley, a Titanic survivor, wrote that the glow "arched fanwise across the northern sky, with faint streamers reaching </p>towards the Pole-star."
		<p>While the solar storm was generating a beautiful lights in the sky, it could have also been disrupting the Titanic's compass. A mere 0.5 degrees would have been enough for the Titanic to go off-course and place it on a </p>course where it collided with the iceberg.
		<p>It is proposed, that if the disruption from a solar storm did take place, it could have influenced distress signals that were sent out from the Titanic. This would have delayed the arrival of any rescue ships.</p>
