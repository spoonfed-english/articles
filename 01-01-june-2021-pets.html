		<p>A <span class="word high">survey</span> by US veterinary group, Banfield Pet Hospital, shows the effects that lockdown has had on <span class="word med" data-lemma="pet">pets</span> and their owners.</p>
		<p>The study shows that the <span class="word high">bond</span> between people and their <span class="word med" data-lemma="pet">pets</span> can help us through difficult times in our lives. Owning a <span class="word med">pet</span> is also good for our health.</p>
		<p>Taking our dogs for walks mean that we can exercise, be outside and meet other people. Taking our dogs for walks and playing with them can <span class="word med">decrease</span> blood <span class="word high">pressure</span> and cholesterol levels. Having a <span class="word med">pet</span> as a <span class="word med">companion</span> can help manage <span class="word high">depression</span> and loneliness.</p>
		<p>October is Mental Awareness Month. The <span class="word high">aim</span> of Mental Awareness Month is to educate the public about <span class="word high">mental</span> health problems such as <span class="word high">depression</span>, <span class="word high">anxiety</span>, and <span class="word high">stress</span>. Being under lockdown, and not being able to see friends and family because of the pandemic, has escalated these problems for many people.</p>
		<p>Pets lower <span class="word high">stress</span> and reduce unhappiness. Stroking your <span class="word med">pet</span> can make you feel calmer and <span class="word high">ease</span> <span class="word low">tense</span> muscles. Playing with your <span class="word med">pet</span> also increases the levels of the feel-good hormones in your <span class="word high">brain</span>.</p>
		<p>Pets are <span class="word high">aware</span> of humans' moods, like when we are unhappy, sad, <span class="word med">depressed</span>, or happy. Caring for our <span class="word med" data-lemma="pet">pets</span> reduces <span class="word high">stress</span>, <span class="word high">anxiety</span>, and <span class="word high">depression</span>. They keep us <span class="word high">company</span> and add joy to our lives.</p>
