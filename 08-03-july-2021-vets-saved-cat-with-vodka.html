		<p>A vet in a small town called Fouriesburg, in South Africa, had to rush to a <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">liquor</span> store to buy the purest form of alcohol possible to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">save</span> Babi's life.</p>
		<p>Thanks to a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">team</span> of vets at the Cluny Animal Trust, a non-<span class="word high" tabindex="-1">profit</span> veterinary organisation, Babi is now a healthy cat. She might have a headache from the alcohol, but other than that she is fine.</p>
		<p>Babi was rushed to Cluny Animal Trust vets by her owner, Mme Reitumetsie, and her grandchildren. They love the cat very much and were very worried about him.</p>
		<p>The children <span class="word high" data-lemma="carry" tabindex="-1">carried</span> Babi almost 2km to the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">clinic</span> after noticing him acting strangely. Fortunately, both the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">clinic</span>'s vets were there when the children arrived with Babi. Babi is a very <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">fussy</span> cat, but they <span class="word high" data-lemma="become" tabindex="-1">became</span> worried when he was not eating and seemed very weak and <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">feeble</span>. Babi was struggling to stand.</p>
		<p>The vets <span class="word high" data-lemma="suspect" tabindex="-1">suspected</span> that Babi was poisoned, so one of the vets, Dr Barker, did a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">procedure</span> to test for poisoning. They <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">found</span> that Babi's urine was a strange lime/yellow colour. Babi then started to vomit a watery <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">liquid</span>.</p>
		<p>The tests showed that Babi had increased glucose levels, which is <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">normally</span> a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sign</span> of diabetes. Babi did not have a history of diabetes and he had been eating and acting <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">normally</span> the day before.</p>
		<p>Now the vets had to start looking for another <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">cause</span> for Babi's illness. They decided that it was <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">kidney</span> failure, and because Babi got <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sick</span> so quickly, it had to be some <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sort</span> of poison.</p>
		<p>They then started thinking that it is winter and gets very cold where Babi lives, with <span class="word high" data-lemma="temperature" tabindex="-1">temperatures</span> reaching -5' Celsius most mornings. They decided that it was anti-freeze, a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">liquid</span> used to help cars to start in the cold, so they <span class="word high" data-lemma="check" tabindex="-1">checked</span> on the internet for more information.</p>
		<p>The information on anti-freeze poisoning showed that Babi must have ingested anti-freeze. The <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">survival</span> rate for this kind of poisoning is not high, unless treated very soon after ingesting it. They were hopeful that Babi would <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">survive</span> as he had vomited earlier.</p>
		<p>The information on the internet showed that the urine would be fluorescent. You cannot see if it is unless you have a fluorescent lamp. Dr Baker rushed to her <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">own</span> <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">clinic</span> to collect her fluorescent lamp. Babi's urine was neon!</p>
		<p>Anti-freeze poisoning is treated with intravenous ethanol. They did not have this at the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">clinic</span> so</p>
		<p>they had to go back to the internet to see what could be used instead of ethanol. The vets <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">found</span> that they could use alcohol such as vodka instead of Ethanol. Dr Barker rushed off to the nearest <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">liquor</span> store to buy a bottle of vodka.</p>
		<p>Babi was on a <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">drip</span> already, so all the vets had to do was to work out the dosage, <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">dilute</span> the alcohol and <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">administer</span> it. Although the vodka was <span class="word low" data-lemma="dilute" tabindex="-1">diluted</span>, Babi got drunk. They had to repeat the <span class="word med" data-lemma="dose" tabindex="-1">doses</span> every six hours for a day and a half and then every eight hours for another day.</p>
		<p>The propylene glycol in anti-freeze <span class="word high" data-lemma="cause" tabindex="-1">causes</span> <span class="word med" data-lemma="crystal" tabindex="-1">crystals</span> to form in the <span class="word low" data-lemma="kidney" tabindex="-1">kidneys</span> which destroys the <span class="word low" data-lemma="kidney" tabindex="-1">kidneys</span>. Ethanol, or the vodka in this <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">instance</span>, <span class="word low" data-lemma="dissolve" tabindex="-1">dissolves</span> the <span class="word med" data-lemma="crystal" tabindex="-1">crystals</span> and allows them to pass into the urine. By the fourth <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">treatment</span>, Babi was nearly back to normal. He was eating again and looked and acted quite differently to when the children had first brought him in.</p>
		<p>They kept him in the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">clinic</span> for a <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">couple</span> of days for observation. His family is happy to have Babi back and that he is his normal self again.</p>
