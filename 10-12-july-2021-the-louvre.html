		<p>Walking through the Louvre galleries to admire the art, is an experience that is hard to beat</p>
	</header>
	<section class="text">
		<p>Most people cannot travel to the Louvre to see its art works. The Louvre only has a small part of their art collection on <span class="word high">display</span> in the museum. There are more than 480 000 artworks in the museum.</p>
		<p>This has now changed. If you have internet, and a smartphone or computer, you can view all their artworks, whenever you want, from any place in the world. The Louvre has recently launched a new online database that <span class="word high" data-lemma="display">displays</span> its entire collection. This database also includes art from the Musee National Eugene Delacroix, <span class="word med" data-lemma="sculpture">sculptures</span> from the Louvre's Tuileries, and the Carrousel gardens, and works from the National Museums Recovery program.</p>
		<p>Items from the National Museums Recovery program are <span class="word high" data-lemma="item">items</span> that were looted by the Nazis and reclaimed by the French after World War II. The Louvre has been working at finding the real owners to return these <span class="word high" data-lemma="item">items</span> to them.</p>
		<p>The database, that will be updated on a regular basis, will allow people to see artworks in storage, on <span class="word high">display</span>, and on <span class="word high">loan</span> to other <span class="word high" data-lemma="institution">institutions</span>.</p>
		<p>This will be the first time that anyone can <span class="word high">access</span> their entire collection. Even the less known pieces can be seen. The Louvre president-director, Jean-Luc Martinez said, "I am sure that this <span class="word med">digital</span> <span class="word high">content</span> is going to <span class="word high">further</span> <span class="word low">inspire</span> people to come to the Louvre to discover the collections in person."</p>
		<p>Due to Covid-19, the Louvre is still closed, so the only way to see the artworks is by viewing them on-line.</p>
