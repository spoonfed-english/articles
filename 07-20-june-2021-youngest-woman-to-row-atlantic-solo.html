		<p>She is a part-time teacher and bartender from Thirsk.</p>
		<p>She began her journey in December when she <span class="word low" data-lemma="depart" tabindex="-1">departed</span> from La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It took 10 days, 3 hours, and 48 <span class="word high" data-lemma="minute" tabindex="-1">minutes</span> to reach Antigua in the Caribbean.</p>
		<p>The triumphant Jasmine Harrison, stood in her rowing boat on her arrival in Antigua. Here her arrival was greeted with a fanfare on Facebook, <span class="word med" data-lemma="broadcast" tabindex="-1">broadcasting</span> her arrival at the finishing <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">line</span>. On arriving on the island, she said her experience had been everything she expected and wanted it to be. When she was asked what she was looking <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">forward</span> to most, her reply was, "Food, <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">definitely</span> food".</p>
		<p>She said the journey of 4828km had good and bad <span class="word high" data-lemma="memory" tabindex="-1">memories</span> but explained that she enjoyed being able to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">escape</span> from normal life. She said, " There's nothing like it, <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">actually</span> getting away from everything - social <span class="word high" data-lemma="medium" tabindex="-1">media</span>, bad news, from <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">literally</span> everything,".</p>
		<p>She <span class="word high" data-lemma="face" tabindex="-1">faced</span> several <span class="word high" data-lemma="challenge" tabindex="-1">challenges</span> on her journey. In early February, her boat capsized twice, <span class="word high" data-lemma="injure" tabindex="-1">injuring</span> her <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">elbow</span>. The rower, Harrison, said that she would row for two hours and sleep for two hours during the <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">crossing</span>.</p>
		<p>After completing her A-levels she visited Antigua. Here she was <span class="word low" data-lemma="inspire" tabindex="-1">inspired</span> to <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">sign</span> up for the Talisker Whisky Atlantic <span class="word high" data-lemma="challenge" tabindex="-1">Challenge</span>. She started training for the <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">competition</span> in January 2020 in Hartlepool.</p>
		<p>Her record-<span class="word high" data-lemma="break" tabindex="-1">breaking</span> <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">feat</span> raised more than 10 000 <span class="word high" data-lemma="pound" tabindex="-1">pounds</span> for <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">charity</span>. This money is going to the Blue <span class="word med" data-lemma="marine" tabindex="-1">Marine</span> <span class="word high" data-lemma="foundation" tabindex="-1">Foundation</span>, which <span class="word high" data-lemma="aim" tabindex="-1">aims</span> to fight overfishing, and ShelterBox, which provides <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">relief</span> for people <span class="word high" data-lemma="affect" tabindex="-1">affected</span> by natural <span class="word high" data-lemma="disaster" tabindex="-1">disasters</span>.</p>
		<p>She wrote in a statement that she wants to <span class="word low" tabindex="-1">inspire</span> young people to get out and do something. Either just to get out of their comfort <span class="word high" data-lemma="zone" tabindex="-1">zones</span>, or to change the world.</p>
		<p>The youngest <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">female</span> rower, <span class="word high" tabindex="-1">prior</span> to Harrison, to <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">tackle</span> the Atlantic <span class="word med" tabindex="-1">solo</span>, was 22-year-old Katie Spotz from the USA, who made the journey between 3 January and 14 <span class="word high" data-lemma="march" tabindex="-1">March</span> 2010.</p>
