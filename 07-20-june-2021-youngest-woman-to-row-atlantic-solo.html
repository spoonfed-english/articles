		<p>She is a part-time teacher and bartender from Thirsk.</p>
		<p>She began her journey in December when she departed from La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It took 10 days, 3 hours, and 48 minutes to reach Antigua in the Caribbean.</p>
		<p>The triumphant Jasmine Harrison, stood in her rowing boat on her arrival in Antigua. Here her arrival was greeted with a fanfare on Facebook, broadcasting her arrival at the finishing line. On arriving on the island, she said her experience had been everything she expected and wanted it to be. When she was asked what she was looking forward to most, her reply was, "Food, definitely food".</p>
		<p>She said the journey of 4828km had good and bad memories but explained that she enjoyed being able to escape from normal life. She said, " There's nothing like it, actually getting away from everything - social media, bad news, from literally everything,".</p>
		<p>She faced several challenges on her journey. In early February, her boat capsized twice, injuring her elbow. The rower, Harrison, said that she would row for two hours and sleep for two hours during the crossing.</p>
		<p>After completing her A-levels she visited Antigua. Here she was inspired to sign up for the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. She started training for the competition in January 2020 in Hartlepool.</p>
		<p>Her record-breaking feat raised more than 10 000 pounds for charity. This money is going to the Blue Marine Foundation, which aims to fight overfishing, and ShelterBox, which provides relief for people affected by natural disasters.</p>
		<p>She wrote in a statement that she wants to inspire young people to get out and do something. Either just to get out of their comfort zones, or to change the world.</p>
		<p>The youngest female rower, prior to Harrison, to tackle the Atlantic solo, was 22-year-old Katie Spotz from the USA, who made the journey between 3 January and 14 March 2010.</p>
