		<p>The man said he had a son, and that sadly his son’s mother had died in a tragic accident.  His girlfriend wanted to know how his wife had died and decided to find out by going onto his wife's online social media.</p>
		<p>She then discovered that his supposedly dead wife was still uploading photos and that she was not dead but rather was still in a relationship with her husband.  His girlfriend then did more searching online and discovered that his wife had posted even more photos.  She found his wife's whole family and career history on the internet.  She was very much alive!</p>
		<p>She confronted him. He denied the fact that his wife was still alive and said his girlfriend was lying.  When her friends asked her whether she had contacted his wife she said she had but that the wife had never read her messages.</p>
		<p>His girlfriend shared her story online: she went on a date with him and found out that he taught school children.  She thought it was very "sweet".  He said he was 25 years old and a single father to his son.  He told her that when he went on dates, the other teachers looked after his son.  He liked running and seemed a very normal person.</p>
		<p>Many viewers who read her story said they had had similar experiences.</p>
